# 🛍️ Retail Sales Forecasting and Insight Generation using Machine Learning

This project explores weekly sales data from multiple retail stores. It includes deep **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, **statistical correlation**, and **machine learning models** to predict future sales trends.

---

## 📌 Objectives
- Analyze if **unemployment**, **temperature**, and **CPI** impact weekly sales.
- Detect **seasonal patterns** and performance variations among stores.
- Identify the **top- and worst-performing stores**.
- Forecast sales for each store for the **next 12 weeks** using predictive modeling.

---

## 🔍 Analysis Performed
- ✅ EDA with visualizations
- ✅ Outlier detection and treatment
- ✅ Handling missing data
- ✅ Correlation analysis
- ✅ Time series trend + seasonality analysis
- ✅ Forecasting using ML models

---

## 📈 Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- Scikit-learn
- Statsmodels
- XGBoost / LightGBM (if used)
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 📊 Key Insights
- Some stores are significantly affected by unemployment.
- Temperature has a seasonal influence on sales (e.g., summer dips).
- Certain stores consistently outperform others, showing strong customer loyalty or better management.

---

## 🧠 ML Modeling
- Time series models like ARIMA or Prophet
- Regression models (Random Forest, XGBoost)
- 12-week forecast generated per store

---
